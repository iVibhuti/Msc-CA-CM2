# Computational Methods Assignment 2

## Singular Value Decomposition:
## Compute The Factor Of The Array/Matrix

  Program takes the input from file (MatrixInput.txt) and compute the factor of a given array or matrix by Singular Value Decomposition.

## Requirements:
Make sure you have Python installed into your system with any IDE that supports python.

## Running the program:

1. Make sure that both file: 1. SVD.py and MatrixInput.txt are in same folder.

2. For Running the Code we have to install the below listed python libraries :-

```
a) numpy - pip install numpy
```
```
b) sympy - pip install sympy
```

3. Then run the SVD.py file 
```
Run: SVD.py
```

## Input file
1. User can change the input matrix from MatrixInput.txt file.
Matrix is saperated by (,) with no space in between. 

## Limitations
The program might not work on 2x2 matrix but works for 2x3 matrix given in the MatrixInput.txt file.
