# Computational Methods Assignment 2

## Singular Value Decomposition:

  Program takes the input from file (input.txt) and compute the factor of a given array by Singular Value Decomposition.

## Requirements:
 check that u have python install and any IDE that support python .

## Running the program:

1. Make sure that both file: 1. SVD.py , input.txt are in same folder.

2. For Running the Code we have to install the python library

```
pip install sympy
```
3. Then run the SVD.py file 
```
Run: SVD.py
```

## Input file
1. User can change the input matrix from Input.txt file.
Matrix is saperated by (,) with no space in between. 

## Limitation

1. Program has some limitation for the imput matrix, It can perform Operation for only 2X3 or 3X2 Matrix.
