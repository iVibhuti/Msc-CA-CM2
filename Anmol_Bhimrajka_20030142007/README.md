# Computational Methods Assignment 1

## About the program:

  Program takes the input from file (input.txt) and check that a given matrix is singular or non singular.
  
  Singular matrix: A square matrix whose  determinant is 0  is called singular matrix.

  Non singular matrix: A square matrix that is not singular, i.e. one that has matrix inverse. Non singular matrices are sometimes also called regular matrices. A square matrix is non singular iff its determinant is non zero.

## Requirements:
 check that u have python install and any IDE that support python .

## Running the program:

1. Make sure that both file: 1. singular_matrix.py 2. input.txt are in same folder.

```
Run: Singular_matrix.py
```
## Input file
1. User can change the input matrix from Input.txt file.
Matrix is saperated by (,) with no space in between. 

2. By Default the dimension of matrix is 3X3.
It will work for 3X3 matrix not for N X N matrix.
