# Computational Methods Assignment 2

## Singular Value Decomposition:
Compute The Factor Of The Array/Matrix
## Program takes the input from file (MatrixInput.txt) and compute the factor of a given array or matrix by Singular Value Decomposition.

# Requirements:
Make sure you have Python installed into your system with any IDE that supports python.

# Running the program:
Make sure that both file: 1. SVD(2).py and input.txt are in same folder.

# For Running the Code we have to install the below listed python libraries : 
  a) numpy - pip install numpy()
  b) sympy - pip install sympy

Then run the SVD.py file
Run: SVD.py

# Input file
User can change the input matrix from MatrixInput.txt file. Matrix is saperated by (,) with no space in between.
# Ouput file
the output file is stored in the output folder as a Screen shot file
