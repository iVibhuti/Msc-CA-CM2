### Singular Matrix Assignment

### unittest module-
The unittest.TestCase parameter in the program is used to create various test cases by subclassing it.
It allows each individual unit of the program to be validated with regard to its expected design performance.

### Steps for execution-
(1) Uncomment the pass regions for test cases that satisfy the condition of singular matrix.

(2) comment the pass regions and uncomment the FAIL regions for test cases that does not satisfy the condition of singular matrix.

### Test Outcomes Possible-
 (1) OK – This means that all the tests are passed. 
 (2) FAIL – This means that the test did not pass and an AssertionError exception is raised.

### Files needed for the program to run-
1)matsingularity.py
2)input_matrix.py
3)Make sure python is installed in your pc
