### ðŸ”¹About  
  
Singular Value Decomposition  
SVD in short, is a matrix decomposition method for reducing a matrix to its  
constituent parts in order to make certain subsequent matrix calculations simpler.  

  
  
### ðŸ”¹Introduction  
  
The program takes in a input matrix and Divides it into factors using SVD.  
Input to the program is given in Input.txt but if user wishes to provide their own matrix they can edit the Input.txt file.  
  
  
### ðŸ”¹Requirements  
  
Python3  
To install python visit this link: (https://www.python.org/).  
  
NumPy Library  
pip install numpy  
  
Math Library
pip install python-math  
  
  
### ðŸ”¹Setup  
  
Download and place the files in a directory.  
Ensure that Input.txt and Svd.py are in same directory.  
If not, Paste appropriate path of Input.txt in InputFile[] section.  
If You wish to make changes to Input.txt Follow the same format.  
Run Svd.py to run the entire code.  
  
  
### ðŸ”¹Input File  
  
Input.txt file follows a comma seperated structure.  
Each line represents row in the matrix.  
Each line has 3 values seperated by comma which represents columns.  
To change Input Values You can Update the same Input.txt and save it.  
*Note: This program may not work with the input of other nXn matrix (n rows & n colmuns).*
