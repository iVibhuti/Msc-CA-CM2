## Objective of Assignment 2:

# To compute the factor of a given array by Singular Value Decomposition.

# Installed package :

# To compute the factor of a given array by SVD in python
 
# you need some lib should be installed in your device to run the code:

# numpy
# math
# scipy

# To run the code:

# download input.txt file and main.py should always be in same directory and also you have to change the in getmatrix("C:\\Users\\Atal\\Desktop\\SVD\\input.txt") and put your repectively directory.
