Program is to check the matrix is singular or non-singular.

Singular matrix: A square matrix whose  determinant is 0  is called singular matrix
Non singular matrix: A square matrix that is not singular, i.e. one that has matrix inverse. Non singular matrices are sometimes also called regular matrices. A square matrix is non singular iff its determinant is non zero.

Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code are put under various tests to determine whether they are fit for use. It determines and ascertains the quality of your code.
The unit test framework in Python is called unittest, which comes packaged with Python.
Unit testing makes your code future proof since you anticipate the cases where your code could potentially fail or produce a bug. Though you cannot predict all of the cases, you still address most of them.
