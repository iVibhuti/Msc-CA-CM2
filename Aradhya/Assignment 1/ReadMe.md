Program to check if the given matrix is singular or non-singular.
About the program:
Program takes the input from file (input.txt) and check if the given matrix is singular or non singular.

Singular matrix: A square matrix whose determinant is 0 is called singular matrix.

Non singular matrix: A square matrix that is not singular, i.e., one that has matrix inverse. Non singular matrices are sometimes also called regular matrices. A square matrix is non singular if its determinant is non zero.

Requirements:
Make sure you have python installed or any IDE that supports python.

Running the program:
1.Make sure that both the files i.e., singular_matrix.py and input.txt are in same folder.
2.Now Run the Singular_matrix.py file.

Input file
1. User can change the input matrix from Input.txt file. 
2. Matrix is separated by (,) with no space in between.

A Unit TestCase to check a Singular Matrix
1. Unit Testing is the first stage of software testing method in which the smallest testable unit of a software are tested. 
2. It allows each unit of the software to be validated with respect to its expected design performance.

Test Case Outcomes
OK - If this outcome appears then it means that all the test cases have met the singular matrix requirements and have passed.

FAIL - If this outcome appears then it means that the test cases have not met the singular matrix requirement and an AssertionError has occurred.
